<!-- Your About Me section -->

Hi, I'm an independent web developer based in Kazan, Russia.

I mostly work with [frontend web development](https://domin.pro), designing user interfaces and improving user experience. My passion is tech so most of the projects I work on are open-source. Some projects are meant to automate my life, some are meant to express my obsession with art.

I'm interested in gaming, studying and experimenting with web design.
